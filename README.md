# snaptools

Tools for analysing data from the snapdragon hybrid zone in the collada de Toses, Spain.

snaptools provides tools for running common operations on
data from the Antirrhinum majus hybrid zone project. The aim is to provide
functions for some specific tasks that multiple people might want to implement,
to avoid replication of effort and creeping errors.
